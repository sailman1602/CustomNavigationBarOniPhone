CustomNavigationBarOniPhone
===========================

This demo shows how to customize NavigationBar on iPhone(iPad is not tested) on iOS4, iOS5 and iOS6(also works on iOS8).

NOTE:
This project is built in 2012 when the latest iOS version is 6.x.
Now that iOS7 is released, and iOS8 is coming, I recommand you use the apperence APIs provided by iOS7.x if your project is targeted on iOS7 and later.
